#2 - When I tried more similar sounding words, the performance was less  successful. 
- When there was a play music in the background, the software became less reliable. 

(a)what can you with your given speech program in the project?
In our project, this speech program would function as a detector or recognizer when we made an order or command. Also, for the communication, we can use this program for giving some feedback. 

(b) How complex do you want your speech recognition to be? How complex can you reasonably expect your speech recognition to be?
The speech recognition would be no that complex because the accuracy can be less if we add too much complexity to our words. I think the words or sounds must be very distinctive. 

(c) What level of speech accuracy do you need? In other words, how quickly do you need an accurate recognition? Does a missed recognition hurt the progress of the game?
I believe the level of speech accuracy must be 90% successful. For example, when I try the same words 10 times, it must get it correctly at least 9 times. 

(d) Do you need specific hardware, specific conditions, etc. to have a reasonable confidence that it works well enough?
I think I will need microphone for speech recognition. I can use Macbook and if the accuracy is not good, I can use a speaker.
